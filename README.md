# Virthon-SRC
I'll update it every update of Virthon 

I removed the protections so anyone can use it

This is a repository of the stealer named "Virthon". I would like to make it clear that I hate people who obfuscate their files. The source code of the obfuscated stealer named Virthon can be found here. [Original Github](https://github.com/stelows/Virthon)

## Why I Hate Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a technique used by developers to make their code difficult to understand. However, I believe that all code should be transparent and understandable. Obfuscation not only makes it difficult to modify a tool, but it also prevents people from learning from it.
Even if Virthon Obfuscation is bad (I mean, Replacing exec with print)

## The Goal of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for those who want to understand how Virthon works. I have deobfuscated the source code to make it more accessible. If you're new to deobfuscation and need some help, there are several tools and resources available that can make the process easier. For example, dnSpy is a powerful tool that can decompile .NET assemblies and make the process of deobfuscation much simpler.

Let's work together to make this repository a place where people can learn and grow in their knowledge of cybersecurity.
